# Roadmap

Since this is a very simple gem, it'll only reach 1.0 when the base set of
features is supported.
After that, only changes to the Falcon server API will be reflected.

- 0.1.1 tests
- 0.1.2 standard log formatting
- 0.2.0 host and port (binding) config
- 0.2.1 sane default server config
- 0.2.2 server config customization
- 0.3.0 platform independant fs watcher
- 0.3.1 watched file list customization
